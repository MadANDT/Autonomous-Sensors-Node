# Autonomous-Sensors-Node
With the STM32WL55JC1 board, the goal is to acquire measures from sensors, send them via LoRa and try to use different low-power modes configurations: <br>
*common sleep mode (Sleep-mode, Low-power run mode, Low-power sleep mode), Stop 0, Stop 1, Stop 2, Standby and Shutdown*.

I will indicate in which context I am using this system later.
